#FCUDA SoC Flow

##Introduction
- This repository contains benchmarks for testing the FCUDA Compiler. These are CUDA benchmarks collecting
from many sources (NVIDIA SDK, Parboil suite, Rodinia suite), and have been modified to adapt to the FCUDA
flow.

##Setup
- This repository needs the FCUDA compiler repository. Please clone the FCUDA repository and follow the 
instructions to set up the entire flow.
